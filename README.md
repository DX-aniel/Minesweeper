# Minesweeper

An application of the Java Swing library in the form of a simple Minesweeper game. 

The game is built on a pair parallel 2D arrays. One for front end data and the other for back end. The front end array stored the information necessary to produce the 2D array of buttons displayed on the UI. The back end array stored the information hidden to the player such as the location of the bombs. The program functions by interfacing the relationship between these arrays. 

Created as a final project for the IB ICS course ICS3U7.
